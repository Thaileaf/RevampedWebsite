## Overview
This is my new website that I created in order to showcase my projects.
In addition, I have added a CI/CD pipeline to learn more about CI/CD principles for large scale
pipelines using GitLab, Docker and Docker Compose, and a host of Open Source tooling.

My portfolio website is available at [lethaison.com](https://lethaison.com)
